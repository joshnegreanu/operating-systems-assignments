To create the small shell executable, run the following command in the directory:

    gcc smallsh.c -o smallsh

This will create an executable called "smallsh". To run it, simply type:

    ./smallsh

Use the same exact name within a script in order to run it in the script.

To remove the executable, run the following command:

    rm -f smallsh
